"""X-LamTo-Occupancy resolution (spec 3.4).

The server validates the header against the caller's own active occupancies
and derives unit + building from the validated occupancy. A client-supplied
building ID is never trusted or accepted. Sole active occupancy -> auto-
selected when the header is absent. Multiple and no header -> 422. An ID that
is not the caller's active occupancy -> 404 (existence not revealed).
